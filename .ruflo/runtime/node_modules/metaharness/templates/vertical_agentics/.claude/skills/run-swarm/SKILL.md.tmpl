# run-swarm

Run a swarm against a goal.

1. Planner builds the dependency-aware plan.
2. Orchestrator dispatches tasks to workers over the bus.
3. Workers execute and write results to shared memory.
4. Critic gates each output; orchestrator replans on failure.
5. Stop when the goal state is satisfied; report the trajectory.
