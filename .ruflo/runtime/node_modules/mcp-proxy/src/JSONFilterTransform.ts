 * without bound: the downstream `ReadBuffer` cap never fires, because it only
 * sees data once a full line is flushed to it, so the filter sat in front of the
 * cap and could exhaust memory instead of failing.
 *
 * Set to twice the SDK's stdio buffer cap rather than equal to it. The filter
 * holds at most one line still being assembled, and a legitimate message is
 * bounded by that downstream cap - so a full-size (or even over-cap) message
 * must still reach `ReadBuffer`, which is the authority on message size and
 * rejects it there. The headroom lets that happen; anything past it is a line
 * that will never terminate, which is what this bound exists to stop.
