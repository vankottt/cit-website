// Self-directed curriculum (ADR-097) — a difficulty LADDER over the benchmark.
// The honest fix for the "degenerate manifold" (Gap 3, benchmark saturation):
// scoring every variant on the full suite from generation 0 means an easy suite
// never forces struggle, so the high-complexity Poincaré frontier (ADR-091/092)
// stays empty. Instead, sequence the EXISTING graded tasks by their `difficulty`
// (1..5): admit only difficulty ≤ L, and raise L once the population MASTERS the
// current tier. Harder tasks arrive exactly when the agents are ready for them —
// "the perfect exam for the current population".
//
// This reuses real task metadata (no LLM task synthesis, no fabrication); it is
// pure and deterministic. An LLM-backed adversarial-task generator can extend it
// later behind the same admit() seam, but the deterministic ladder works today.
