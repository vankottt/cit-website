# @metaharness/router

**Route each query to the cheapest model that's good enough.** The productized
form of the DRACO Phase-2 finding (`ruvnet/agent-harness-generator`, ADR-040):
on cross-domain research, structure/fusion does *not* beat a strong model on
quality — but routing each query to the *right, cheapest* model is a measured
Pareto win. A learned embedding router beat the best fixed model on DRACO, and
its accuracy rises monotonically with training data (the learning curve).

Dependency-free, no model files, no network. Bring any embedding model; the
router only needs the vectors.

## Install

```bash
npm install @metaharness/router
```

## Use

```ts
import { Router } from '@metaharness/router';

const router = new Router({
  qualityBar: 0.8, // cost-optimal: cheapest candidate predicted to clear 0.8
  candidates: [
    {
      id: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5',
      costPerMTok: 3,
      examples: [ /* { embedding, quality } from your eval logs */ ],
    },
    {
      id: 'anthropic/claude-opus-4',
      costPerMTok: 45,
      examples: [ /* ... */ ],
    },
  ],
});

const pick = router.route(queryEmbedding);
// → { id, predictedQuality, costPerMTok, metBar }
```

For each candidate the router predicts quality on the new query via k-NN over
that candidate's labelled `examples` (query embedding → quality it achieved),
then returns the **cheapest candidate predicted to clear `qualityBar`** (or the
best-predicted if none clear it / no bar is set). Feed it your own eval logs;
the more examples, the closer it gets to the per-query oracle (DRACO's learning
curve was still rising at n=19).

## Why this and not "a bigger model" / "more structure"

DRACO measured it honestly: structure degrades quality, and a cheap model
matches frontier quality at ~10× lower cost. The leverage is **choosing** the
model, not wrapping it. This is that choice as a library.

## Trained router (kernel ridge regression)

For a *learned*, regularised router (vs. plain k-NN), train one from the same
dataset — no model files, no native deps, pure TS (ADR-043):

```ts
import { trainRouter, TrainedRouter } from '@metaharness/router';

const { router, lambda, looQuality } = trainRouter(rows, prices, { qualityBar: 0.8 });
// rows: [{ embedding, scores: { modelId: quality } }]  · λ fit by leave-one-out CV
const pick = router.route(queryEmbedding);

// persist / reload the trained model (portable JSON)
const json = router.toJSON();
const same = TrainedRouter.fromJSON(json);
```

KRR with a cosine kernel is the regularised generalisation of k-NN; `λ` (fit by
LOO) controls the bias–variance trade-off that hurts k-NN on small data. On the
DRACO n=20 dataset it ties k-NN (the data ceiling); it's the router that
generalises better as your eval set grows.

## Native FastGRNN router (optional, `@ruvector/tiny-dancer`)

The pure-TS router above needs zero native deps. For a trained *native* model,
the **same `{ embedding, scores }` dataset** drives a real FastGRNN (Rust/NAPI,
gradients + Adam, persisted to `.safetensors`) — programmatically:

```ts
import { trainNativeRouter, NativeRouter, isNativeRouterAvailable } from '@metaharness/router';
// needs `npm i @ruvector/tiny-dancer` (optional peer); falls back to pure-TS otherwise
const res = await trainNativeRouter(rows, prices, { outputPath: './router.safetensors' });
const router = await NativeRouter.load({ modelPath: res.modelPath });
```

…or with **zero code** via the published CLI (validated on the DRACO routing
dataset — trains at the full embedding dim, e.g. 1536):

```bash
npx ruvector tiny-dancer train draco.json --out model.safetensors --prices '{"haiku":1,"opus":15}'
npx ruvector tiny-dancer score model.safetensors --query @query.json   # high → route cheap
```

Pick the backend automatically with `resolveRouterBackend('auto')` (`'native'`
when tiny-dancer is installed, else `'js'`). See ADR-043 for the measured data
ceiling and the train↔route dimension note.
