/**
 * Controller Prerequisites Registry
 *
 * Documents which agentdb controllers can be auto-activated by downstream
 * consumers (e.g. ruflo's memory bridge) versus which require external
 * dependencies that the embedding host has to supply.
 *
 * Issue #146 Gap 2 — downstream consumers were reading dist source to discover
 * which controllers were safe to default-construct. This module hoists that
 * information into the public API so callers can do:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { controllerPrerequisites } from 'agentdb';
 *
 * const safe = controllerPrerequisites.filter(c => c.requirements.length === 0);
 * // → controllers whose constructor needs no external resources
 * ```
 *
 * The data is hand-curated and tracked alongside controller source files so
 * adding a new controller forces a registry update in the same change.
